files structure:
Docker files
-I assume that docker is integrated part of code base
and this is why docker-compose.yml and Dockerfiles are on
the same level as code, not in a separate folder. It makes
easier running command such as `docker-compose run` itp.
and run it from makefiles.
- Work required to make a docker environment as pluggable
directory cost more effort than it benefits development.

TODO:
DONE - refactor dockerfiles to root folder
- save and read image in backend
- command to do dummy data - insert dummy data
